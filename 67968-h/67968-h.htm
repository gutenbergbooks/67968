<h2 class="nobreak" id="How_to_use_the">How to use the
COLD-CONTROL</h2>
</div>


<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img003">
  <img src="images/003.jpg" class="w25"  alt="Climate control knob" />
</span></p>

<p>Under normal conditions, your
Frigidaire refrigerator will automatically
provide the right temperature for
keeping foods good to eat. However,
for special purposes, temperatures
which are lower than normal may be
required. These are described below.
The Cold-Control is located at the
upper right hand corner of the food
compartment. To change the setting
of the Cold-Control, simply turn towards
you for colder temperatures,
away from you for warmer temperatures.</p>

<p><b>For normal use</b>—Leave the Cold-Control
on Number “1”. Even in hot
summer weather this setting will be
satisfactory because your Frigidaire refrigerator
automatically adjusts itself
for changes in kitchen temperatures.</p>

<p><b>For fast ice freezing</b>—Set the Cold-Control
on Number “7”. This provides
fast freezing. After the ice
has frozen, turn the Cold-Control
back to its normal setting.</p>

<p><b>For freezing desserts, salads and
other foods</b>—Set the Cold-Control
on Number “7,” until dessert or salad
has frozen to the desired consistency.
Then turn back to Number “3” or “4.”
This will keep it at the proper temperature.
Package foods to be frozen
according to suggestions on page 8.</p>

<p><b>For keeping frozen foods</b>—When
you keep commercially frozen foods
or commercial ice cream in the Super-Freezer,
leave the Cold-Control on
Number “3” or “4” as long as the foods
are to be kept frozen. To thaw foods,
place packages on one of the food
compartment shelves for 24 to 48
hours. Remove entirely from the refrigerator
for fast thawing.</p>

<p><b>Vacation Setting</b>—When you’re
away from home for a number of
days and foods are to remain in your
refrigerator, set the control on one of
the economy positions “A,” “B,” or
“C.” This will maintain a satisfactory
temperature because the cabinet door
will not be opened, and no warm foods
will be placed in the food compartment.
If no foods are to remain in the refrigerator,
remove the electrical cord from
the outlet, remove all foods and ice
trays, and leave door open. This allows
food compartment to air out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="How_and_when_to">How and when to
DEFROST</h2>
</div>


<p class="center p2"><span class="figcenter"  id="img004">
  <img src="images/004.jpg" class="w25"  alt="Freezer compartments" />
</span></p>

<p>It is normal for frost to build up on
the Super-Freezer. This comes from
moisture in the air that enters the food
compartment when the door is opened.
When this moisture strikes the cold
surface of the Super-Freezer, it turns
to frost. Removing the frost periodically
keeps operating costs low.</p>

<p><b>When to remove frost</b>—The speed
with which frost builds up depends
upon the amount of moisture in the
air and how many times you open the
refrigerator door. When the frost
builds up to about ¹⁄₄ inch, or the
<i>thickness</i> of a pencil, it should be removed
by one of the methods below.</p>


<h3>Defrost the FAST way when storing frozen foods</h3>

<p>When you are keeping frozen foods,
it is important to defrost as rapidly as
possible so that frozen foods can be returned
to the Super-Freezer before they
have had a chance to thaw out. Proceed
as follows:</p>

<p class="p0"><b>1.</b> Remove frozen foods from freezer
and wrap them in several thicknesses
of newspaper. Place them in some cool
spot in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>2.</b> Remove all trays from the freezer.
Remove all foods from Cold Storage
Tray located beneath the freezer.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>3.</b> Turn the Cold-Control to “Off”.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>4.</b> Place a pan of hot water in the
freezer. An ice tray may be used for
this purpose but the water should then
be warm <i>not HOT</i> as hot water may
damage the waxed surface of the trays.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>5.</b> As the frost begins to melt, it will
drop into the Cold Storage Tray. DO
NOT USE ANY SHARP INSTRUMENT
TO REMOVE FROST.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>6.</b> When all frost has melted and has
been disposed of, reset the Cold-Control
to “4”, wash the Cold Storage
Tray, place it back in position and
return foods to freezer.</p>


<h3>Regular Defrosting</h3>

<p>When foods are not being kept in the
Super-Freezer, this slower method may
be used:</p>

<p class="p0"><b>1.</b> Follow step “2” above.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>2.</b> Set Cold-Control to ‘Defrost’ and
leave in this position overnight, or
until all frost has melted.</p>

<p class="p0"><b>3.</b> Follow step “6” above.</p>

<p>NOTE: The best time to clean your
refrigerator is while it is being defrosted.
See page 10 for cleaning instructions.</p>

</div>


<h3><b>Frozen Foods</b></h3>
<p>Place in Super-Freezer directly on freezer shelf or in Meat-Tender. See <a href="#Page_8">page 8</a> for information on freezing foods.
</p><h3>
<b>Milk and Tall Bottles</b></h3>
<p> Store on shelf on either side of Super-Freezer. Put milk in your refrigerator as soon after delivery as possible.</p>
<h3><b>Meats and Poultry</b></h3>        <p>Meats and Poultry to be kept more than a few days, keep
best when frozen. See <a href="#Page_8">page 8</a>. Poultry should be thoroughly
washed and dressed, then placed in Meat-Tender.
Smoked meats may be kept in the Meat-Tender for as
long as two weeks. Fish should always be kept frozen in
the Super-Freezer. Meats and Poultry to be kept for short
periods may be stored in the Cold Storage Tray.
</p>
<h3><b>Regular Foods</b></h3>             <p>Butter, leftovers and other foods subject to drying out,
should be stored in covered containers on any convenient
shelf. Cheese should be wrapped in waxed paper for short-time
storage, or in moisture-vapor-proof material for longer
storage. Eggs should never be washed before placing in refrigerator,
as this removes their protective coating.
</p>
<h3><b>Leafy Vegetables</b></h3>           <p>Trim, discard undesirable portions, wash thoroughly with
cold water and store in Hydrator. Lettuce, celery and similar
vegetables keep better if stalks and heads are not cut up or
portioned. Carrots, radishes, beets, etc., should be trimmed,
washed, drained and placed in Hydrator. Tomatoes, peppers,
and cucumbers should be washed and wiped dry before
placing in Hydrator. Asparagus and Brussel sprouts should
not be washed until prepared for cooking. They may be
placed on any convenient shelf of your refrigerator.
</p>
<h3><b>Fruits</b></h3>                     <p>Oranges, apples, lemons, grapefruit, grapes, etc., should be stored in the Hydrator.

when freezing foods or storing frozen
foods, desserts or salads.</i></p>


<p><b>Freeze foods for longer storage—</b>
Foods that are to be kept for more
than a few days—especially meats
and leftovers—keep better frozen.
Many other types of foods may also
be frozen successfully. These include
fruits and vegetables, poultry, cooked
foods, even cakes, pies and other
baked goods!</p>


<p><b>Correct wrapping for freezing—</b> Foods to be frozen should be wrapped
or packaged in waxed paper if to be
stored for few days. For longer periods
use materials made especially for
home freezing. Wrap carefully, as
illustrated above, being sure to exclude
all air.</p>


<p><b>Using frozen foods—</b> Frozen meats may be cooked from
the frozen state or thawed before
cooking. If cooked from the frozen
state allow extra cooking time.
Cook meats at low temperature. Use
a meat thermometer with roasts and
other large cuts for best results.
Frozen vegetables should be cooked
from the frozen state. Some pre-cooked
frozen foods should be thawed
before warming. Fruits are often
served while still partially frozen.
For cooking commercial frozen foods
follow instructions on package.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Keeping">Keeping
commercially frozen
foods</h2>
</div>


<p>Commercial frozen foods may be kept
for several weeks by placing them in
the Super-Freezer in direct contact
with the top or bottom freezer shelf.
Follow instructions on the package
for thawing or cooking. Frozen
foods once thawed should not be refrozen.</p>

<p>Commercial ice creams keep best
when removed from packages and
placed in one of the Quickube Trays
in the Super-Freezer.</p>

<p><b>To remove trays—</b>

Pull the tray handle downward. This
will release the most stubborn tray.</p>


<p><b>To remove cubes—</b>

Place one hand on top of the tray,
lift tray release lever with other
hand. This will release cubes, two or
a trayful as desired.</p>

<p>Fill trays only two-thirds full of
water. Keep on hand only as many
trays of ice as will actually be needed.
Use the rest of the Super-Freezer
space for frozen desserts or frozen
foods. The double-width tray is especially
valuable for making larger
quantities of salads and desserts.</p>

<h3>What the Meter-Miser is</h3>

<p>The Meter-Miser is the heart of your
Frigidaire refrigerator. It is an exclusive
Frigidaire feature—quiet, simple,
trouble-free. The Meter-Miser Compressor
has two simple parts that move—so
economical, it uses no more current
than an ordinary light bulb. The
Meter-Miser and the entire sealed-in
mechanical system of your Frigidaire
is protected by a 5-year Protection Plan
which is covered on <a href="#Page_23">page 23</a>.</p>


<h3>Oiling</h3>

<p>You never have to oil the Meter-Miser.
A lifetime supply is sealed-in at the
time of manufacture and never needs
changing or replenishing.</p>


<h3>If You Should Move</h3>

<p>Before moving, the Meter-Miser
should be securely locked in place by
tightening down completely the shipping
nuts shown by arrows in the
illustration below. These nuts should be loosened
before your Frigidaire refrigerator
is again put in operation.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="figcenter"  id="img013">
  <img src="images/013.jpg" class="w50"  alt="Dessert image" />
</span></p>


<h3>Location in Room</h3>

<p>The closer any refrigerator is placed to
a source of heat, the more current it
will use. If possible, locate your refrigerator
away from any source of extreme
heat or cold.</p>

</div>


<h3>Cabinet Exterior</h3>

<p>Wipe with a damp cloth. For more
thorough cleaning use a damp, soapy
cloth. Then rinse and dry well. For
stubborn stains on Dulux-finished cabinets,
use Frigidaire Dulux Surface Renewer<a id="FNanchor_1a" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>—or
Frigidaire Porcelain Speed
Cleaner<a id="FNanchor_1b" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> for porcelain finished exteriors.
Do not use strong gritty soaps,
scouring powders or acids.</p>


<h3>Quickube Trays</h3>

<p>Wash with soap or warm water—NEVER
hot water. Do not use metal
sponges or scouring powders as these
may damage the tray surface and
make ice cubes difficult to remove.</p>


<h3>Other Interior Equipment</h3>

<p>Use a solution of one teaspoonful of
soda to a quart of warm water. Rinse
with clear water.</p>


<h3>Rubber Door Seal</h3>

<p>Use water or Frigidaire Nu-Coat<a id="FNanchor_1c" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>.</p>

</div>

<h3>BOTH FROZEN AND CHILLED</h3>


<p>· Any fresh vegetable or fruit salad must be thoroughly chilled and served on a crisp
salad green if it is to appear and taste its best. Frigidaire provides the proper storage
conditions so necessary for keeping salad materials fresh and crisp until serving time.
<b>Please see <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a></b> for suggestions on the storage of vegetables, fruits and salad materials.</p>

<p>Frozen salads are quite a delicacy and can be made so easily in Frigidaire’s Quickube
Ice Trays. You can freeze an individual salad inside each grid of the tray—then by
merely lifting the lever, the entire grid can be removed, leaving the individual salads
in the tray for use as needed.</p>


<h3>Fruit and Vegetable Salad</h3>

<p class="center"><i>six servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
1 cup shredded pineapple<br />
¹⁄₂ cup celery<br />
¹⁄₂ cup raw carrots<br />
1 package lemon gelatine<br />
1¹⁄₂ cups boiling water<br />
</p>

<p>Drain the pineapple. Chop the celery and grate
the carrots. Then combine ingredients. Add

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HELPFUL_HINTSabout_frozen_desserts">HELPFUL HINTS—about frozen desserts</h2>
</div>


<p>· No longer is it necessary to use whipping cream or prepare a custard in order to make a
dessert with an exceptionally fine texture. <i>Tasty, inexpensive desserts can be made with
coffee cream—with half coffee cream and half milk—or even with milk alone.</i></p>

<p>In making these desserts there are certain points that must be observed. Complete
information is given with each recipe.</p>


<h3>Use of coffee cream</h3>

<p>Coffee cream may be used in place of
whipping cream in many frozen desserts
by the following method. Substitute an
equal amount of coffee cream for the combined
quantities of whipping and coffee
creams indicated in the recipe. After the
first mixture of ingredients has been
chilled, add the coffee cream and place in
Frigidaire freezing tray until firmly frozen.
Then remove the contents of the tray
to a very cold mixing bowl and whip with
an electric or hand beater until the mixture
becomes light and creamy. Return to
freezing tray and allow to finish freezing
without further agitation.</p>

<p>Coffee cream usually contains 18 or 20
per cent butterfat. It can be used in place
of whipping cream for garnishing desserts
by first pouring into the freezing tray
and allowing it to freeze before whipping.
After whipping, place in the freezing tray
for additional freezing in order to hold
it in proper consistency until serving time.</p>


<h3>Freezing method</h3>

<p>Your Frigidaire refrigerator has the Cold-Control
to speed up freezing. The directions
for using it should be followed.</p>

<p>The best method is to set the Cold-Control
at the coldest position approximately
one-half hour before placing the mixture
in the freezer for freezing. This assures
colder temperatures in the freezing compartment,
which results in faster freezing
and better desserts. After the mixture is
completely frozen, the Cold-Control
should be set at an intermediate position
to keep the dessert in the proper consistency
until serving time. <i>Important Note:
Please see <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a> for use of Cold-Control.</i></p>


<h3>Mellowing improves desserts</h3>

<p>All desserts, regardless of kind or the time
required for freezing, are much improved
in flavor and texture by allowing them
to mellow. Especially is this true for fruit
creams, fruit salads and similar combinations.
This is accomplished by allowing
the dessert to remain in the freezing compartment
at a higher temperature than that
at which it is frozen for some time before
it is served. This temperature is obtained
by setting the Cold-Control at an intermediate
position, as described on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>


<h3>To avoid buttery taste</h3>

<p>A buttery taste in frozen deserts is usually
caused by one of two things. Either the
cream has been over-whipped or it is too
rich in butterfat. The butterfat content of
whipping cream varies greatly in different
states. In certain localities whipping cream
will contain as high as 40 per cent butterfat,
making it too rich for a frozen dessert.
In this case, it should be diluted with coffee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
cream or milk. The standard butterfat
content for whipping cream is 28 per cent.
However, it is possible to whip cream containing
only 20 per cent butterfat if it is
first poured into the freezing tray and allowed
to chill to the freezing point.</p>

<p>· A great variety of delicious frozen creams can be made in the freezing trays of your
refrigerator. It’s no trick to make them and by trying some of the following recipes you
will find that tasty, inexpensive desserts can be made without whipping cream.</p>

<p>Remember that proper temperatures for freezing desserts are just as important as the
recipe itself in obtaining the best results.</p>


<h3>Vanilla Custard Cream</h3>

<p class="center"><i>six to eight servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
³⁄₄ cup granulated sugar<br />
2 tablespoons cornstarch<br />

2 egg whites<br />
</p>

<p>Mix granulated sugar and cornstarch. Add
scalded milk gradually, stirring constantly. Cook
in double boiler 25 minutes or, if you have an
electric range, use saucepan on LOW or SIMMER
heat. If time will permit, cooking for one
hour greatly improves the flavor and will make
for a better texture in the frozen dessert. Stir several
times during cooking process. Combine with
well-beaten egg yolks. Cook for five minutes
or until thick, stirring constantly. Cool, add salt,
cream. Pour into freezing tray. When frozen remove
to bowl, add vanilla, and whip with electric

<p><b>Mousses</b> retain their popularity because they are so simply and easily prepared.
Whipped cream forms the base of these desserts and stirring is unnecessary during the
freezing process.</p>

<p><b>Parfaits</b> are rightly regarded as a very rich delicacy. They are served only when the
occasion calls for something very attractive and when calories can be disregarded. The
parfait itself is very easily prepared and the same method of preparation is applicable
to each recipe. Parfaits are most acceptable when served with strawberries, raspberries
or other fruit. However, flavored syrups with nuts are very good substitutes—garnishing
with maraschino cherries when desired.</p>

<p><b>Novelty Desserts</b>—Many times you will want to serve something just a little different;
maybe a special dinner dessert, afternoon or evening refreshments, or that “dessert
bridge” you have been planning for some time. On these pages are a number of suggestions
to help you in planning for these occasions.</p>


<h3>Apricot Mousse</h3>

<p class="center"><i>ten or twelve servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
1 large can apricots or 2¹⁄₄ cups apricot pulp<br />
2 egg whites<br />
1¹⁄₂ cups cream, whipped<br />
¹⁄₂ cup sugar<br />
</p>

<p>Drain the contents of can of apricots and force
through a sieve. There should be 2¹⁄₄ cups of
apricot pulp. Place in freezing tray and allow
to remain for 45 minutes. Remove from the
tray and turn into a bowl containing the unbeaten
egg whites. Beat until light and fluffy.
Whip cream, gradually adding sugar. Fold the
cream into the beaten apricots and eggs. Return
to the tray and freeze without stirring.</p>


<h3>Strawberry Mousse</h3>

<p class="center"><i>ten servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
1 pint strawberries<br />
1 cup granulated sugar<br />
2 teaspoons lemon juice<br />
2 cups whipping cream<br />
2 egg whites<br />
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt<br />
</p>

<p>Wash and stem berries. Add sugar and crush.
Heat until sugar is dissolved. Strain and chill.
Add lemon juice to berry mixture. Fold in
whipped cream and stiffly beaten egg whites to
which salt has been added. Pour into freezing
tray, molds or individual cups. Freeze without
stirring. See <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a> for use of Cold-Control.
This dessert is very attractive when frozen in
silver cups, and decorated with whipped cream
or whole, fresh berries.</p>


<h3>Butterscotch Parfait</h3>

<p class="center"><i>ten to twelve servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
²⁄₃ cup brown sugar<br />
2 tablespoons butter<br />
¹⁄₂ cup water<br />
4 egg yolks<br />
1 pint whipping cream<br />
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt<br />
2 teaspoons vanilla<br />
</p>

<p>Combine sugar and butter. Heat until melted.
Cook for one minute. Add water; cook until
butterscotch is melted. Add syrup mixture slowly
to beaten egg yolks. Cook in double boiler until
light and fluffy. If you have an electric range,
cook in saucepan on LOW or SIMMER heat.
Chill. Add whipped cream, salt, and vanilla.
Pour into freezing tray or individual cups.
Freeze without stirring. Chopped nuts may also
be added. See <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a> for use of Cold-Control.</p>


<h3>Frozen Crumb Cake</h3>

<p class="center"><i>four to six servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
1 cup whipping cream<br />
2 cups sponge cake broken in small portions (Any left-over cake can be used. Angel food cake is delicious served in this manner)<br />
¹⁄₄ cup chopped English walnuts<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Whip cream and combine with cake. This
should be tossed together with a fork. Add
chopped nuts and pour into freezing tray.
Freeze without stirring. Slice for serving.</p>

<p>Fruit may be added to the above recipe if
desired, either frozen with the cake or chilled
and served with the frozen cake. Maraschino
cherries may be added. This is an excellent way
of using those unused portions of cake and
small portions of fruit.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Cookie Dessert</h3>

<p class="center"><i>six to eight servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
18 thin chocolate cookies (1¹⁄₂ inches in diameter)<br />
1 pint whipping cream<br />
2 teaspoons vanilla<br />
</p>

<p>Whip cream and add vanilla. Spread one tablespoon
on one cookie and press another on top.
After four or five cookies have been added, lay
the stack on edge lengthwise in the center of
the freezing tray; complete the roll; then completely
cover with remainder of whipped cream.
Place in Frigidaire on a shelf for several hours,
allowing cookies to absorb some of the moisture
from the cream. Garnish with maraschino
cherries or chocolate shot. Place in freezing compartment
and allow to thoroughly chill or
freeze. When freezing, please see <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a> for
use of Cold-Control. Serve in diagonal slices
and add a small portion of chocolate sauce to
each serving.</p>

<p><i>Variation</i>: Ginger cookies may be used the
same as chocolate cookies, and served without
chocolate sauce.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Bavarian Cream</h3>

<p class="center"><i>ten servings</i></p>

<p class="ml2 p0">
1 tablespoon gelatine<br />
¹⁄₄ cup cold water<br />
1¹⁄₂ squares chocolate<br />
²⁄₃ cup sugar<br />
¹⁄₁₆ teaspoon salt<br />
¹⁄₂ cup hot milk<br />
1 pint whipping cream<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla<br />
6 lady fingers<br />
</p>

<p>Soak gelatine in cold water. Melt chocolate in
top of double boiler and add sugar, salt, and
hot milk. If you have an electric range, use
saucepan on LOW or SIMMER heat. Cook for
a few minutes. Add gelatine to hot chocolate
mixture. Cool until it begins to thicken. Beat
with beater until mixture becomes very light.
Fold in whipped cream. Add vanilla. Line a
mold with lady fingers. Pour in cream mixture.
Place in Frigidaire freezer to chill. When dessert
has set, remove to a plate and decorate
with whipped cream before serving.</p>
